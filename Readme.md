# 🐍 Python Projects Repository

Welcome to my **Python Projects Repository** — a collection of analytical, data-driven, and AI-focused projects developed to showcase my skills in **data analytics, visualization, and applied machine learning**.  

Each project here demonstrates end-to-end problem-solving using real-world datasets, clean coding practices, and effective data storytelling through Python.

## 🧠 About This Repository
This repository serves as a **central hub** for all my Python-based projects — from **data analysis** to **machine learning**, **automation**, and **AI applications**.  
Each project is self-contained with:
- A dedicated folder structure  
- Jupyter Notebooks for analysis  
- Visualizations and results  
- Detailed documentation (`README.md` files)
