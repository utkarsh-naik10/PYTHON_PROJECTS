This section focuses on what drives or characterizes different types of crimes.  
It covers crime methods (MO codes), case status, use of weapons, and relationships between demographic factors and crime outcomes.

**Insights:**
- Across **gender**, both males and females show high frequencies in MO codes **0344, 1822, and 0913**, indicating theft and break-ins are not gender-specific.
- **Adults (30–44)** and **young adults (18–29)** dominate the MO pattern count, showing high exposure and activity in most recurring crimes.
- Among **ethnic groups**, **Hispanic/Latin/Mexican** and **White** victims appear most frequently across theft-related MO codes.

## 4️⃣ Crime Status Distribution

![Crime Status Distribution](Crime%20Status%20Distribution.png)

**Insights:**
- Around **80%** of cases are marked as **“Investigation Continued”**, showing the majority are still open or under review.
- About **11%** fall under **Adult Other**, usually meaning dismissed or unprosecuted.
- Only **8.7%** of cases end in **Adult Arrest**, showing a wide gap between reported and resolved incidents.

## 5️⃣ Case Status by Crime Type

![Case Status by Crime Type](Case%20Status%20by%20Crime%20Type.png)

**Insights:**
- **Vehicle theft** has the highest number of ongoing investigations (**107K+ cases**).
- **Assault and burglary** cases also show large “Invest Cont” values, while arrests remain a small fraction.
- Crimes like **simple assault** and **intimate partner violence** show higher “Adult Other” outcomes, often linked to dropped or unresolved cases.

## 6️⃣ Percentage of Crimes Involving Weapons

![Percentage of Crimes Involving Weapons](Percentage%20of%20Crimes%20Involving%20Weapons.png)

**Insights:**
- About **67%** of all crimes involve **no weapon**, confirming that most are non-violent or property-based.
- **One-third (32.6%)** involve weapons — a significant figure that reflects physical threats or armed thefts.

---

## 7️⃣ Relationship Between Weapon Usage and Case Status

![Relationship Between Weapon Usage and Case Status](Relationship%20Between%20Weapon%20Usage%20and%20Case%20Status.png)

**Insights:**
- Most weapon-related crimes are still under **investigation**, especially when no weapon code is recorded (611K+ cases).
- For cases with known weapon use, **Adult Arrests** occur more often than Juvenile ones.
- Suggests that weapon-involved incidents are complex and take longer to close or prosecute.

---

## 8️⃣ Top Weapons Used by Crime Type

![Top Weapons Used by Crime Type](Top%20Weapons%20Used%20by%20Crime%20Type.png)

**Insights:**
- **Firearms and bodily force (hands/fists)** are mainly tied to **assault** and **battery** crimes.
- **Burglary from vehicle** shows limited weapon use, aligning with property theft motives.
- **Identity theft** has zero physical weapon involvement, confirming it as a digital or paperwork-based offense.

## 9️⃣ Yearly Trend of Weapon-Related Crimes

![Yearly Trend of Weapon-Related Crimes](Yearly%20Trend%20of%20Weapon-Related%20Crimes.png)

**Insights:**
- Weapon-related crimes increased until **2022**, then started to drop by **2024**.
- Code **400 (handguns)** and **500 (cutting instruments)** remain stable, while **code 0** (no weapon) dominates every year.
- The gradual decline may reflect better surveillance or incomplete 2024–2025 data.

## Summary of Observations

| Category | Observation |
|-----------|--------------|
| **Crime Methods (MO Codes)** | Theft and burglary-related codes (0344, 1822) dominate across years and areas. |
| **Weapons** | 2/3 of crimes are weapon-free; most violent cases involve physical force rather than firearms. |
| **Case Status** | 80%+ cases remain under investigation, indicating long processing timelines. |
| **Victim & Demographics** | Hispanic and White groups are the most represented across major MO categories. |
| **Geographical Pattern** | Central and Southwest areas repeatedly show high MO code concentrations. |

## Notes

- This notebook (`4.Contributing_Factors_&_Crime_Characteristics.ipynb`) analyzes **underlying factors** such as MO patterns, weapon use, and investigation outcomes.
- Data visualizations were created with **Matplotlib** and **Seaborn** for clear pattern recognition.
- The focus is to understand **how** crimes are carried out, **where**, and **what factors** influence resolution rates.
