# Crime Data from 2020 to Present  
A Complete Python-Based Crime Analytics Project

This project analyzes LAPD crime data from **2020 to the present**, focusing on crime trends, victim patterns, contributing factors, and location-specific risks.  
All work in this folder is done using **pure Python**, supported by Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, and Seaborn.

## 📂 Folder Structure

### 1️⃣ Exploratory_Data_Analysis  
This section covers the initial exploration of crime trends over time, area, crime type, and reporting delays.  
It answers questions like:  
- Which years and months see the most crime?  
- Which LAPD areas report the highest crime volumes?  
- What are the most common crime categories?  
- How do crime counts vary by day, time, and season?  
This folder sets the foundation for deeper analysis by showing the **bigger picture**.

### 2️⃣ Severity_&_Victim_Analysis  
This section focuses on **who the victims are** and **how severe the crimes tend to be**.  
It includes:  
- Age group vs crime type patterns  
- Weapon-based severity analysis  
- Victim gender analysis  
- Victim descent distributions  
- Area-wise victim comparisons  
This gives clear insights into **victim demographics**, **vulnerable groups**, and **crime severity behavior**.

### 3️⃣ Vehicle_Type_&_Premise_Analysis  
This part examines crimes involving vehicles and the places where crimes most frequently happen.  
Key areas covered:  
- Vehicle theft trends  
- High-risk areas and time frames for vehicle crimes  
- Top premises where crimes occur (streets, homes, parking lots, etc.)  
- Victim profiles for vehicle-related crimes  
- Weapon usage in vehicle incidents  
This helps understand **how environment and location shape crime patterns**.

### 4️⃣ Contributing_Factors_&_Crime_Characteristics  
This is a deeper look into **how crimes are carried out** and what factors influence outcomes.  
Main topics:  
- Most common MO (Method of Operation) codes  
- MO patterns across age, gender, and descent  
- Case status outcomes (arrests, investigations, unresolved cases)  
- Weapon involvement and yearly weapon trends  
- Relationship between weapon use and case closure  
This section shows the **behavioral and procedural aspects** behind reported crime incidents.

## 📌 Summary

This entire folder gives a **complete end-to-end analysis** of crime data—  
from overall trends to victim insights, location risks, and behavioral patterns of incidents.

It shows:  
- What types of crimes happen  
- Who they affect  
- Where they occur  
- How they happen  
- How cases progress  

This makes the project useful for:  
- Crime pattern research
