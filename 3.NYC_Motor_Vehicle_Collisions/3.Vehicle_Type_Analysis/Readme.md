**Insights:**
- **Sedans** are involved in the highest number of crashes, crossing **640K** incidents.  
- **Station Wagons/SUVs** come next, followed by **Passenger Vehicles**.  
- **Taxis** show the lowest crash count among the listed types.  
- The trend suggests that the most common personal-use vehicles (like sedans and SUVs) naturally have more crash involvement due to their higher numbers on the road.

![Vehicle Types: Total Crashes vs Fatality Rate](./Vehicle%20Types_%20Total%20Crashes%20vs%20Fatality%20Rate.png)

**Insights:**
- While **Sedans** lead in total crashes, **Motorcycles** have a much higher **fatality rate (over 2.5%)**, making them the riskiest type of vehicle per crash.  
- SUVs and Passenger Vehicles have moderate fatality rates despite high crash counts.  
- The sharp fatality spike for motorcycles highlights the vulnerability of riders in urban traffic.

### 🧭 Summary
- Sedans and SUVs dominate crash counts, reflecting their common use in NYC.  
- Motorcycles, though less frequent in crashes, are **far more dangerous** in terms of fatal outcomes.  
- These findings can help guide targeted road safety measures, such as improving motorcycle awareness campaigns and enforcing safety gear use.
