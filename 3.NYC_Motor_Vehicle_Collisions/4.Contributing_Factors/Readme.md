**Insights:**
- **Brooklyn** and **Queens** report the highest crash numbers across most contributing factors.  
- **Driver Distraction** and **Unspecified causes** dominate across all boroughs.  
- **Failure to Yield** is more frequent in **Queens and Manhattan**, likely due to dense intersections.  
- **Backing Unsafely** occurs more often in **Brooklyn**, possibly due to high parking density.
